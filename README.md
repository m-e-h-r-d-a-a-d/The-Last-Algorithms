## Introduction

This repository contains my Golang implementations for the projects and samples covered in the online course "The Last Algorithms." While the original course was implemented in TypeScript by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) I've implemented all the code in Golang, providing an alternative perspective for learners who prefer or are interested in the Go programming language.
